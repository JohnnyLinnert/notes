# Itching

Over the past couple weeks, when riding the bus or after seeing signs for Tokyu's new transport app, I have been getting the urge to pop open Xcode and begin working again on the bus notifier application I began October 2016, and put on hold back in February 2017 when I started my new PM gig at AQ.

At the time, I was working on managing a front-end development project where it was important that I understand the way websites are structured.   

This website (johnnylinnert.com) came forth from my desire to work more fluidly with my colleague, who happened to be the front-end developer on the project.

The state that the site is in now represents a (very limited, but solid)
foundation for my understanding of the web, and there will be more experiments to be had from here on out. Onward!
